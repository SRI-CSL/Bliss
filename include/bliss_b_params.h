/*
 * Why we use M = p_max (by Tancrede)
 *
 *
 *
 * Let's go:
 *
 * It should always hold that p->M >= norm_v in order to ensure that
 * 1/(M*exp(-||v||^2/(2*sigma^2))) <= 1
 *
 * BLISS-B states that ||v||^2 < P_max, where P_max is given on p.7
 *
 * *** Therefore you see here that you need p->M = P_max. ***
 *
 *
 * Let's take BLISS-B1
 * P_max = 17825
 * Which makes exp(-17825/(2*215^2)) = 0.6800330729375813
 * and a repetition rate m that needs to verify m >= 1.21264863594269231
 * which yields alpha = sqrt(1/(2*log(m))) = 1.610362655
 *
 * The values M and alpha from BLISS-B are actually not parameters,
 * they are approximate values to understand what is going on.
 *
 * If you had taken alpha=1.610, we would have
 * exp(1/(2*1.61*1.61)) = 1.2127539833
 * and if we compute p->M as you did, it now yields
 * p->M = ((2*sigma^2)/(2*alpha^2)) = (sigma/alpha)^2 = 17833.031 (we need to take the ceil)
 * (this is where BLISS-B error in the paper is:
 * alpha = sigma / sqrt(P_max)) and not alpha = sigma/P_max)
 *
 *
 *
 * Anyway, the *real* value one should be taking for p->M is P_max
 * computed as in BLISS-B p.7
